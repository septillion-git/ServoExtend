/* 
 
 A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
 The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method
 
 ************EXTEND*******************
 Added option is to drive with the internal ticks for more resolution as well as a function for DCC steed steps times 4 (gives 0-1012)

 Added a reattach() function without giving the pin number again
 
 Small change to setting just 4 ticks for a disabled servo.
 
 Now accepts all Arduino pins up to 126 (7-bit instead of 6-bit) with 127 as return for no pin.
 *************************************
 
 Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are disabled when the first servo is attached.
 Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two timers, 48 servos will use four.
 
 The methods are:
 
 ServoExtend - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.
 
 attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
 attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
 default min is 544, max is 2400  
 reattach(pin) - Reataches a pin if it was once atteched, returns 127 is nog pin set.
 
 write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
 writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds
 writeTicks() -Sets the servo pulse width in ticks of the uC. Smalles possible step. Between 1088 and 4800 by default (F_OSC/8)
 writeDccStep() - Sets the pulse width in a 4 times multiple of DCC staps (2*127) * 4 gives a range of 0-1012
 read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
 readMicroseconds()   - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
 attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
 detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
